This is a script to automate lessons to elearnity using Python language, selenium library and webdriver.

1. You have to install python in your computer
2. pip install -U selenium // in your project directory
3. pip install webdriver-manager // in your project directory

Put in your credentials in username password and run it for each lesson

You can change the links for the lessons when you complete the hours for one of them.

It runs in loops of 30 minutes so you just have to run it once and leave it as long as it needed for each lesson (etc 20 hours for html5).
